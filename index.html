    <h5 class="card-title">Problem</h5>
    <p class="card-text">It is difficult for people to incorporate new healthy habits into their daily life. We hope to help users form healthy habits using a new app that we create so they will be more susceptible to adopting and retaining formed habits.GoalSync is designed to help users form and stick to new habits through accountability. We have observed that current products aren’t meeting these goals.</p>
      
       <h5 class="card-title">Solution</h5>
    <p class="card-text">As a team, we wanted to create an app so that users are successful in adopting and retaining healthy habits by giving them the ability to connect with other users that have common goals.</p>
      
       <h5 class="card-title">Inspiration</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The recent pandemic has forced people to become socially isolated from others and separated from their normal routines. In this time of isolation, people will be able to self-reflect on their lifestyle choices and how they want to manage/change their physical and mental health routines right now and after this quarantine is over. People have been given a chance to slow down and with this habit-forming app, they have the capability, help, and motivation to adopt new habits that will continue to to better their daily routines and overall lives in the future. </p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Research</h5>
    <p class="card-text">We conducted 9 user interviews on people that we believed fit our user proto-persona. Our main research objectives were to understand what motivates people to start healthy habits, acknowledge how people adopt healthy habits and recognize how people stick to adopted habits so we could gauge what users wanted in an app that would guide their good habits.</p>

    <h6 class="card-title">Synthesis</h6>
    <p class="card-text">To synthesize our interviews our team created an Affinity Diagram. We found that most people felt that reward-based reinforcements kept them more focused on their goals and had trouble sticking to habits when they weren’t held accountable.</p>
